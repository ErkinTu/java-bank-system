# Simple Banking System 🏦💻

Hey there! 👋

Without deep knowledge of Java syntax, I built a **super simple banking system** with a **UI interface**. 🚀
The project follows an **MVC + Service** architecture and I tried my best to stick to SOLID principles! 🧠🛠


### Technologies used:

- Standard Java Libraries

- javax.swing and java.awt for the UI 🎨

📚 This is a **learning project** created during our **2nd year OOP course** at the university.
As we progressed through the lessons, we gradually developed this simple banking system together. 🏫✨


### Requirements 📋

- Java JDK 8+ ☕

- Any Java-friendly IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) 🛠


### How to Run ▶️

**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone
cd src/main
```

**Compile the project:**
```bash
javac Main.java
```

**Run the app:**
```bash
java Main
```


Stay tuned, more improvements might come soon! 😉
